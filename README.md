# Portfolio

### Hey this is my portfolio repo. 

I've been working on this project for a while now. It started off with me not knowing much about 
how to create anything at all. I just wanted to create something of my own.

Through a lot of tutorials, learning and re-programming my slow brain and then to bug fixing, researching and experimenting over and over.
I was able to build this the way I wanted it to be. I added technologies I was interested in so I can experiment more with them.  

It taught me a lot of things I had no idea I needed to know to make a modern website from ground up.
